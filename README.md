# Ruhd
Rules of the card game
## Overview 
Ruhd is a card game. Each card is a square tile where each side has a color and a number. There are 4 different colors and the numbers go from 1 to 4. One at a time, players place a tile from their hand an already placed tile on the board against. The game ends when the deck is empty and each player has played their remaining tiles. The winner is the player who has scored the most points.
## Setup
1. Shuffle the deck
2. Place 3 tiles in a "L" shape on the table, this will be the starting board
3. Give 2 tiles to each player
4. Set the drawing deck, the number of tiles in it depends on the number of players
    - 2-4 players: 12 tiles
    - 5+ players: 2 tiles per player
5. Set aside the remaining tiles, they will not be played during this game
6. Select a starting player, however you prefer
## Taking turns
1. Place a tile from you hand on the board, against at least 1 already existing tile
2. Score your points
3. Draw a tile from the deck, if the deck is not empty
## Scoring points
1. One-side rule: If you placed your tile against no-more than 1 tile on the board, you score 1 point
2. Diff-diff rule: If a side from the tile you placed touches a side of a different color, you score the number difference between those 2 tiles
3. Same-same rule: If a side from the tile you placed touches a side of the same color and number, you score that number
4. Pattern rule: If you created a recurring pattern of 3 or more colors or numbers in 1 direction, you score 2 points
All the rules cummulate, and the pattern rule can trigger multiple times if more than 1 pattern was created.
After scoring, if you drew you new tile, or if the next player already placed their tile, you cannot claim points that you might have forgotten or missed.
Ruhd doesn't come with scoring tokens, so use a pen and paper, or a scoring app.

Here are some examples of what triggers the pattern rule, and what doesn't.
