If the video linked above isn't enough, below are the written rules.

Rules of the card game

## Overview 

Ruhd is a card game. Each card is a square tile where each side has a color and a number. There are 4 different colors and the numbers go from 1 to 4. One at a time, players place a tile from their hand beside an already placed tile on the board. After placing a tile, the player scores points following the rules. The game ends when the deck is empty and each player has played their remaining tiles. The winner is the player who has scored the most points.

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck
2. Place 4 tiles face up on the table in an square shape, this will be the starting board
4. Set the drawing deck face down, 5 cards per player
6. Set aside the remaining tiles, they will not be played during this game
7. Draw the first 4 tiles from the deck and place them face up in a line beside the deck, this will represent the shared open hand for the players
8. Select a starting player, however you prefer

## Taking turns

1. Place a tile face up beside at least 1 face up tile on the board, you can select your tile from either
  * The shared open hand
  * Any of the tile face down on the board, except the last one that was placed
2. Score your points
3. Pick a tile from the shared open hand and place it face down over 1 face up tile on the board

At any point, if the shared open hand is empty, replenish it up to 4 cards from the deck

## Scoring points
1. One-side rule: If you placed your tile beside no more than 1 tile on the board, you score 1 point
2. Diff-diff rule: If a side from the tile you placed touches a side of a different color, you score the difference between the 2 facing numbers, the higest number minus the smallest number
3. Same-same rule: If a side from the tile you placed touches a side of the same color and number, you score that number
4. Pattern rule: If you created a pattern of 3 identical colors or numbers in the same axis of the tile you placed against, you score 2 points. Extending an existing pattern doesn't grant points

All the rules are cumulative:
- When placing a tile beside more than 1 tile on the board, each side can trigger the Diff-diff or Same-same rule
- The pattern rule triggers as many times as there were patterns created
- When placing a tile beside more than 1 tile on the board, each side can trigger pattern rule on their own axis  

After scoring, if the next player already placed their tile, you cannot claim points that you might have forgotten or missed.

Ruhd doesn't come with scoring tokens, so use a pen and paper, or a scoring app.

### Face down tiles

Face down tiles count as unoccupied spaces, but you cannot place a tile on top of them. You cannot score points from the tile that is covered. Here are the ground rules:

* You cannot score points when uncovering a tile, even if patterns are created, only placing a tile down grants points 
* You can benefit from the One-side rule even if you place your tile beside one or more face down tiles, face down tiles are considered obstructed empty spaces
  * You must however place your tile beside at least one face up tile, always
* Covering a pattern effectively destroys it, allowing you to create it again from a different location and score points again

### Pattern rule

Here are some examples of what triggers the pattern rule, and what doesn't. The highlighted tile is the tile placed by the player.

Below is a single pattern of 4s on the left side being created.

![Pattern1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688838/224567089-0c6e3348-efb9-4959-8fca-e60d8afda83f.png)

Below is a triple pattern being created. The left side has both 4 and blue triplets, and the right side has a yellow triplet. The patterns alone would grant 6 points.

![Pattern2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688838/224567079-96817a15-1e79-432a-b085-10e5181a44ba.png)

Below are two patterns. The left side has a blue triplet while the right side has a yellow triplet. The patterns alone would grant 4 points.

![Pattern3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688838/224567071-0f3b02ce-d76d-4523-94ae-645d8abb8137.png)

Below is an odd example, but valid nonetheless. Because the pattern didn't exist yet, creating the pattern of 5 yellows on the right grants 2 points. A pattern is only considered already existing if at least 3 tiles were connected. 

![Pattern5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688838/224566532-00f5341c-c7e2-4292-8584-a58ad78a2543.png)

#### Invalid patterns

Below, the blue pattern already existed, placing this tile will not grant any pattern creation points.

![Pattern4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688838/224567064-7cab0ebd-b125-4fff-88e5-2649c042e747.png)

Below, the tile is placed on the right side of an existing one. When placing a tile on the right or left of an existing tile, only horizontal patterns - pointing left or right - can be counted on that axis. The 3 yellows facing down do not count as a pattern. Similarly, if a tile is placed above or below an existing tile, only vertical patterns - pointing up or down - can be counted on that axis.

![Pattern6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2688838/224571677-5ff43be9-d049-4597-a748-84ed37f64bff.png)

1. The one-side rule doesn't apply since the tile is palced against 2 tiles
2. The left side of the placed tile uses the Diff-diff rule, which equates to 2 minus 1, thus 1 point
3. The bottom side of the placed tile uses the Same-same rule, which equates to 3 points because the facing numbers are 3s
4. A pattern of reds facing left is created on the left, granting 2 points
5. A pattern of 1s facing left is also created on the left side, granting 2 more points
5. A pattern of greens facing up is also created on the bottom side, granting 2 more points
The total for this tile placement is 10 points.

## Special thanks
Thanks to my friends who helped iterating the game to what it is now.
